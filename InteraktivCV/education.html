          <h3>Elementry School</h3>

              >Kråkerøy Ungdomsskole</a
            >. There I went and learned some more advanced english >, but I also
            chose a new subject which was physical activity. I did this for 3
            years until I eventually finished middle school.

            <a href="https://ofk.no/glemmen-vgs/">Glemmen Videregående Skole</a
            >. There I chose to specialize myself within electronics as an
            electrician, but in the second year I chose to further specialize
            myself in fine electronics like computers and lower voltage stuff.
