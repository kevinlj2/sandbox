          <h3>German</h3>
          <p>
            When I went to middle school we had the choice between multiple
            langues to choose. I chose german and I have beginner knowledge in
            German, and I can maintain a basic conversation in German.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>French</h3>
          <p>
            I am self taught through duolingo and I can understand french to
            somewhat degree, unfortunently I am not able to maintain a full
            conversation in french. Only parts of the conversation.
