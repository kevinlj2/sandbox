          <h3>Military Service</h3>
          <p>
            I was serving in the military from 12th april 2023 to 9th april
            2024. My position was welfare soldier. I made sure the soldiers time
            at base was enjoyable and that the moral was uplifted. I served my
            time with HV-12 in
            <a href="https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trondheim">Trondheim</a>.

          <h3>Working in a grocery store</h3>
          <p>
            When I got home from the military I was in need of money so I
            started working in a grocery store. I worked there over the summer
            until I started studying informationsystems.

          <h3>Apprentice in an electronic store</h3>
          <p>
            In my second year of high school we had to go to a local industry
            and be with them for a day in the week. And I went to Target Inc.
            who sells finer electronics like Radios, and kettles and stuff like
            that. I was there for a couple of months until the end of the school
            year.
